# Voice Server API

Uses Python TTS library with switches to allow different models to be used (vits, glow and cloned). Runs as an API server. I also allows for speed control to make the voice sound more comical.

## Set Up

Python 3.10 or 3.11 is recommended. (Python 3.12 is not supported due to dependency issues.)

```bash

# install python3.11
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa   # may be required if the next line fails
sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv python3.11-dev

# make your venv
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
